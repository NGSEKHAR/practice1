Deploy your code, files, configurations etc. to multiple servers via ssh.
Perfect for the cloud. Written as a shell script (sh, standard bourne shell) and
runs on every unix server. No need for remote install. Just run the
deploy.sh script on the local machine.

Usage
=====
 To deploy, run:
 ./deploy --install [ .deploy location ]
 
 To update already existing deployment, run:
 ./deploy --update [ .deploy location ]
 
 It will run copy, replace and update-s2...
 
 Partial deployment options:
 ./deploy --begin        Run begin script
 ./deploy --copy         Copy files to /tmp
 ./deploy --replace      Replace the old files
 ./deploy --finish       Run the finish script
 ./deploy --update-s2    Run the update script, only
 
 If the location where the .deploy file isn't specified, deploy.sh will assume
 it's in the current directory.

What you need
=============
 - The same username to all servers.
 - An ssh keyfile without passphrase.
 - The ssh key should be the same for all servers.
 - [optional] Root access or sudo without password.
 - sh or bash.
 
 Note:
 	This script was designed for elastic cloud computing.

Installation
============
 - Copy deploy.conf to /etc/deploy.conf
 - Create a .deploy file in your project. You can use the sample deploy file
   shipped with this release. Just make sure to rename it.
 - Put the deploy.sh in a handy place like /usr/local/sbin/deploy.sh and make it
   executable. If you want you can even put it in your project location.
   
Tips & trix
===========
 - To make it even easier you can let any heartbeat software update
   the deploy.conf automatically.
 - Write your .deploy file with if statements etc. to make it easy to rerun it
   everytime there's new servers or if the old ones need any updates.
